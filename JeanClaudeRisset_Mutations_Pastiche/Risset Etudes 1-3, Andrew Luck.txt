Etude 1


In the opening etude I explored the portamento-like pitch bend in the attack found on Risset’s resynthesized woodwind instrument in Mutations at 3:05.  The spectrum consists of frequencies from Risset’s bell partials.  


Next, Risset’s prism is emulated, with a bell sound as opposed to stricly partials. Risset’s pitches collect rapidly and travel up and down the spectra painting full colors throughout Mutations.


An AM synthesized kick drum-like knock follows, matching tempo and phrasing to Risset’s.  (Mutations 3:11)


Closing the piece is another “bell prism”, this time with a lower frequency and scrambled set of pitches for variation.


Etude 2 


Opening with a prism more kindred to Risset, the pure tone additive sines travel up and ring out with a long release.  (Mutations, 3:38)


Clangourous bells derived from the sames pitch class of a lower frequency jump into the peaceful drone.


An AM generated bell, with a slow logarithmic attack sweeps up and fades out evenly. This swelling tone drones in and out of mutations and serves as an interpolating transitional element.


As the clangorous bells continue, their decay mutates and grows longer, leaving us with an unsettling dissonance.




Etude 3


Our space invader takes off and explodes into space.  A single side-band rises with a stacatto skip.  This SSB distortion grows and gives us a feeling of liftoff.  It’s not as compelling as one of Risset’s Shephard tones, but it has a similar doppler-esque quality.


A noise explosion (Mutations 1:03) pans across the sound stage.   We have transcended...into noise distortion technique.


A slow bell prism transposes in three octaves, creating an ominous drama.  


The pitched attack sines sing to us in inquisitive and mysterious tunes.  


The clean AM bell slowly blends into the mix, climaxes, and takes us out for a finish.
